bugs to fix:   
    del causing operators to reset when they shouldnt; could fix with isOperator()? function that checks what the last
    item is before resetting certain buttons

    deleting operator does not allow new numbers to be added to previous set of numbers

features to add:
    shadow result (predicitve result)
    keyboard support
